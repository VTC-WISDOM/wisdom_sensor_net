Basic Packet Structure:
 
	MSB
	|A|S|T|F|N|P|*...

	A - Rx address 														 1 byte

	S - Packet size in bytes (<= 255) 				 1 byte

	T - Tx address                             1 byte

	F - Packet information flags 							 1 byte

	N - Packet series number                   1 byte

	P - A variable sized payload of size       (S - 3) bytes

	*Appended CRC data is irrelevant to packet structure. 


Packet Information Flags

	 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
	|r|b|d|s|m| | | |

	r - Request Transmission Packet

			Signals to the recipient that the sender is prepared to 
			begin transmission. This happens before the BTP.

	b - Begin Transmission Flag
			
			Marks the first packet in a series of reliable datagram
			packets. The payload contains the series number of the final
			packet along with the first slice of data, effectively telling the 
			recipient how many packets it should expect to receive.

			Always packet number 0 

	d - Data Flag

			Indicates a standard data packet following a begin transmission packet.

			Packet number >= 1

	a - Reverse Ack Flag 

			Notifies the transmission sender either:
			1. It never recieved the BTP so please resend.
				 Payload contains one byte with value 0x00. 
			2. BTP was received, but not all DPs were recieved. 
				 Payload contains one byte each with a missing packet number. 
			
	s - Success Flag

			Notifies sender that transmission was receieved correctly. 

	m - Metadata Flag

			Notifies receiver that the packet contains metadata.
