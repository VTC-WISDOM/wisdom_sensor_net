Basic Packet Structure:
 
	MSB
	|A|S|T|F|N|P|*...

	A - Rx address 							   1 byte

	// Limited to 66 bytes to avoid complex large packet operations
	// This may change in the future
	S - Packet size in bytes (<= 66) 		   1 byte 
													 
	T - Tx address                             1 byte

	F - Packet information flags 	 		   1 byte

	N - Packet sequence number                 1 byte

	P - A variable sized payload of size       (S - 3) bytes

	*Appended CRC data is irrelevant to packet structure. 


Packet Information Flags

	 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
	|r|d|a|c|s| | | |

	r - Request Begin Transmission Flag

			Signals to the recipient that the sender is prepared to 
			begin transmission. Includes the number of packets to be 
			sent along with the total size of payload in bytes. 

	d - Data Flag

			Indicates a standard data packet.
	
	a - Ack flag

			Signals to sender that request transmission was receieved
			and transmission can begin.

	c - Reverse Ack Flag 

			Notifies the sender that transmission was receieved, and if
			any packets need resending. 
			
	s - Success Flag

			Notifies sender that transmission was receieved correctly.
