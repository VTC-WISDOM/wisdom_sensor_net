Build initial parser
	- parse for error
	- parse for OK
	- Recognize unsolicited resonses
	- Recognize garbage data

	Parser should be fed a data stream which can be parsed
	User should then be able to step through the responses with an easy way to identify
	what type of response it is if contents are unimportant.

	Internally, circle buffer makes the most sense so that it is easy to just add and remove
	parsed/unparsed data without affecting any currently incomplete responses at the end
	of the buffer.

Continue building any necessary helper functions (non-checking)

- Configure modem
- Configure CN
- Check SIM status
- Connect to carrier network
- check carrier network states
- Connect/disconnect to TCP
- Send/Recv TCP
- Check TCP send packet status

Build checking (w timeout) helper functions for when waiting for response is wanted.
Because responses are never guaranteed even with a proper command, all blocking helper functions
should receive a timeout time in us if no valid return value is recieved.

Implement security key file functionality - should be pulled in during build.
Implement SLS security

Build a model for gateway-server communication.
Begin rebuild of server with more moduler design. Current server is messy and hard
to modify. Time to code with some intentionality.
